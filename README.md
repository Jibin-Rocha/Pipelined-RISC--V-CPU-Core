# Pipelined-RISC--V-CPU-Core
The following repository contains all the information and codes that's needed to a build a 4-stage Pipelined RISC-V Core which is designed during the RISC-V MYTH Workshop. The core supports the RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set. It is developed and implemented in TL-Verilog on Makerchip platform

# Introduction to RISC-V ISA 
* RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established RISC principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available, and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.
